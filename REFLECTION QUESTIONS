## QUESTION 1: Why is the OLTP system normalized and the OLAP system denormalized? 

1. The OLAP is normalized to avoid redundancy: 	A customer's data is stored once (in customers table), not repeated in every transaction.
2. To ensure data Integrity
3. Optimize transaction speed

The OLAP sysytem is denormalized
1.For faster query perfomance: Queries don’t require complex joins—data is already flattened and ready for aggregation.
2. Read-Heavy Workloads: OLAP systems mostly read data (not update/insert), so repeated data isn’t a big problem.
3.Simplified queries



## QUESTION 2: What challenges would you face if you ran analytical queries directly on the OLTP 
system? 





## QUESTION 3: How can automation (e.g., scheduled ETL jobs) help in a real-world data 
pipeline?

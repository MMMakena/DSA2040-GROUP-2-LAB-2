## QUESTION 1: Why is the OLTP system normalized and the OLAP system denormalized? 

1. The OLAP is normalized to avoid redundancy: 	A customer's data is stored once (in customers table), not repeated in every transaction.
2. To ensure data Integrity
3. Optimize transaction speed

The OLAP sysytem is denormalized
1.For faster query perfomance: Queries don’t require complex joins—data is already flattened and ready for aggregation.
2. Read-Heavy Workloads: OLAP systems mostly read data (not update/insert), so repeated data isn’t a big problem.
3.Simplified queries



## QUESTION 2: What challenges would you face if you ran analytical queries directly on the OLTP 
system? 





## QUESTION 3: How can automation (e.g., scheduled ETL jobs) help in a real-world data 
pipeline? 
1. Scalability:
Automated pipelines can handle increasing data volumes by scaling the process without requiring proportional increases in manual monitoring or intervention, making it easier to grow the data infrastructure seamlessly.

2. Version Control and Rollbacks:
Automation scripts and ETL workflows can be managed with version control systems, allowing easy rollback to previous stable states if new data transformations introduce errors, thus improving pipeline maintainability and robustness.

3. Reduced Manual Workload:
Automation frees up data engineers and analysts to focus on higher-value tasks like data modeling or analytics instead of repetitive data wrangling.
